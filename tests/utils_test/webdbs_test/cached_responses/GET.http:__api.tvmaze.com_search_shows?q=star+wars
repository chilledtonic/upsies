The sensibilities just <i>mesh</i> in a way that produces wonderfully spirited, irreverent entertainment. But nothing could prepare you for the out-and-out fun of the new limited series, <i>Lego Star Wars: Droid Tales</i>, which premieres tonight at 9:30 p.m. on Disney XD. <i><b>\"Lego</b> <b>Star Wars: Droid Tales\"</b></i>, is a five-episode miniseries that has an ingenious conceit: it's the entire <i>Star Wars</i> saga, told, <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</i>-style, by C3PO (voiced, once more, by Anthony Daniels) and R2D2. The series takes place after the Battle of Endor that ended <i>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</i>, as C3PO first recounts his adventures after being assembled by a young Anakin Skywalker. This first episode does a really killer job whittling down both <i>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</i> and <i>Star Wars: Attack of the Clones</i> and even introduces a nifty wraparound narrative wherein C3PO and Admiral Akbar team up to track down his missing spaceship (just go with it).</p>","updated":1502472013,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/2269"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/349305"}}}}]
